# Comparison of RNN and Transformer in Sentiment Analysis

Here is a toy example of sentiment analysis on the imdb dataset with both RNNs and Transformers.

* sentiment-analysis.ipynb loads the pre-trained models and allows you to experiment by inputting movie reviews
* rnn_sentiment_analysis_experimentation.ipynb generates and trains an RNN model with your custom parameters
* transformer_sentiment_analysis_experimentation.ipynb generates and trains an Transformer model with your custom parameters
* results_and_analysis.ipynb contains code to visualize the results from experimentation
* models contains our pre-trained models
